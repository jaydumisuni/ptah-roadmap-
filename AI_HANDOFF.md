The accepted programme is:

```text
P00 Master-plan authority closure — COMPLETE
P01 Physical-host and ADR-0033 closure — ACTIVE / BLOCKED ON EXACT PHYSICAL HOST
Programme A Online Ptah Alpha — PLANNED / NOT AUTHORIZED
Programmes B–F — PLANNED
```

## Exact next action

On the exact Ubuntu Server 24.04.4 LTS / x86_64 / `6.8.0-136-generic` physical proof host, check out the selected clean reviewed `Ptah-space` preparation commit and run:

```bash
python3 tools/run_pinned_host_proof.py \
  --repo-root . \
  --output evidence/phase0c/pinned-host-candidate
```

Require `proof_eligible: true`, empty failure sets and complete package/APT artifact evidence. Then independently retain the same exact bundle:

```bash
python3 tools/retain_verified_pinned_host_evidence.py \
  --repo-root . \
  --bundle-dir evidence/phase0c/pinned-host-candidate \
  --output-dir evidence/phase0c/pinned-host-durable-candidate
```

Review and explicitly accept host identity, capabilities, installed packages, package artifacts, APT sources/indexes, durable bytes and repository binding.

## Remaining authorization sequence

```text
Physical pinned-host proof
→ package/package-artifact acceptance
→ durable bundle commit and acceptance
→ final Phase 0C consistency review
→ ADR-0033 acceptance
→ explicit Runtime implementation: AUTHORIZED
→ A01 becomes READY
```

## Hard boundary

```text
Master Plan: ACCEPTED
Implementation roadmap: ACCEPTED
ADR-0034: ACCEPTED
Physical-host proof: OPEN
ADR-0033: PROPOSED
Runtime implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED
```

No chat, model or owner-intent statement may replace the missing physical evidence and reviewed ADR-0033 closure.
